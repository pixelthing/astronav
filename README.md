## A Polestar meeting room finder

"Where is Menkent?" - we've all been there, the meeting is already staring and you have no idea what floor "Adheera" or "Nunki" are on, let alone how to find them. And the PDF maps are somewhere on the Intranet, and the touch screen map by the kitchen doesn't seem to have all the rooms on it.

This project (eventually) is a mobile webapp/PWA that allows you to quickly type (or say?) a meeting room name and quickly be presented with it's location on a 3d map of the PSHQ.
